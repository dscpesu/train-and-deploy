## About The Event

Train and Deploy is a code-along event where students will learn about different types of ML models, training them and deploying them to a web application. The event will cover the basics of making an ML model, and will explore how to deploy the model. At the end of this program, students can walk away with the basic skills required to build an end-to-end ML project.
